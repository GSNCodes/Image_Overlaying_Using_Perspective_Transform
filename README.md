# Image_Overlaying_Using_Perspective_Transform
Using the concept of Perspective Transform to overlay one image onto another with OpenCV-Python  

## Overview
In this project, we use opencv to warp an image and merge it with another image. The code is written in such a way that it allows us to choose four points in the base image. The subject image is warped in such a way that it fits within the boundary outlined by the chosen points. For more details you can refer to my article on **Medium [here]**. The base image is on the left, and the subject image is on the right.

<img src ='base_img.jpg' width = 300 height=250> <img src ='subject.jpg' width = 300>  

**Selecting the corner points**   
Every time you click on a point, the chosen point is highlighted using a red dot as shown below.  

<img src ='points_selector.gif' width = 300 height=250>  

## Output :
<img src ='images/Final_Output.png' width = 300 height=250>   

## Usage :

To run without debug enabled :-  
`python main.py --base_img base_img.jpg --subject_img subject.jpg`

To run with debug enabled :-  
`python main.py --base_img base_img.jpg --subject_img subject.jpg --debug True`

Enabling debug would allow you to visualize the intermediate masks and processed images so that 
you can better analyze where you're going wrong and remedy the problem accordingly.
