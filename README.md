# Image_Overlaying_Using_Perspective_Transform
Using the concept of Perspective Transform to overlay one image onto another with OpenCV-Python  

In this project, we use opencv to warp an image and merge it with another image. For more details
you can refer to my article on Medium [here].

<img src ='base_img.jpg' width = 300 height=250> <img src ='subject.jpg' width = 300>  

## Output:-
<img src ='images/Final_Output.png' width = 300 height=250>
